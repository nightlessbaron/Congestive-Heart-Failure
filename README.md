# Congestive-Heart-Failure
Implementation of the research paperDeep CNN for the automated diagnosis of congestive heart failure using ECGsignals. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a chronic heart condition associated with debilitating symptoms that result inincreased mortality, morbidity, healthcare expenditure and decreased quality of life. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasiveandsimplediagnosticmethodthatmaydemonstratedetectablechangesinCHF.Thisprojecthasimplementedan 11 layer CNN to obtain an accuracy of 99.07%. This project is an amalgamation of multiple tools such as TensorFlow,Keras, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. Results: Introduction to the deep learning and CNN. Got to learn various deeplearning tools mentioned above.
